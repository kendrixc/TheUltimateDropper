## Summary:
The goal of this project is to create an AI that can play the map The Dropper by Bigre. In the map, the player must complete 16 different levels; in each level the agent starts off at the top of a large drop and must control themselves as they fall—with the goal of landing safely in water located at the bottom of each level.  Each level increases in difficulty by adding more blocks and structures the agent must avoid hitting.  For inputs—the agent will receive a map of the blocks located directly around and below it (20 x 10 x 10).  The AI then outputs which direction it believes the agent should move (NSEW), or not at all; this is done continuously as the agent falls. The agent is rewarded based on the vertical distance it traveled before failing or succeeding.
